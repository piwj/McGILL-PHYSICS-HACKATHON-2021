Hi Everyone, and welcome to our project Augmented Collisions. 

In this project we utilzied an Intel RealSense D435i rgbd camera to simulate the basic physics of collisions in an augemented reality landscape. 

Users are able to spawn virtual spheres by clicking on the screen and interact with them by bringing their hands or other objects within 50 cm from the camera.

Future work would allow users to vary different parameters like the coefficient of restitution and the force of gravity to be able to learn more about these physics principles.

Tools Used: 
- Intel Realsense D435i
- OpenCV 3.4 or newer
- Python 3.8.10

How to Run:
- Plug in and install driver for Intel Realsense D435i
- Run main.py and enjoy!
